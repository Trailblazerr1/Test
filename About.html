          <p>Unlike many other word puzzles and games, few people actually know where hangman games come from. It does seem, however, that they were invented sometime during the Victorian era. The 1894 work Traditional Games appears to be one of the first places hangman puzzle is mentioned. From then on word games have spread all over the world.</p>

          <h1>Tips</h1>
          <p>Most hangman games are not too difficult, but like any word game they can sometimes be tricky. These tips should help you solve the puzzle and win.</p>
          <p><b>1</b> Choose the most common letters first:</p>
          <p>It is best to start with the most common letters used in the English language and not more obscure letters like q or x. Many people find that they have a good chance    `of solving if they begin by choosing e, r, s, t, l, n.</p>
          <p><b>2</b> Place a Vowel:</p>
          <p>Every word needs a vowel, so try to place a vowel in a word right away. If you have a lot of empty spaces and a lot of consonants, the chances are good you are        missing a vowel.</p>
          <p><b>3</b> Deduce the word and then choose its letters:</p>
          <p> After you guess a few letters, you may be able to make a good guess as to what the final solution to the word game will be. Guess the letters that would be in that solution to see if you are correct.</p>
          <p>Have Fun Today Solving the Hangman Word Game. Good luck!!</p>
